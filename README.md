# Full-Stack-Web-App-Node.js-Express-MongoDB
I made this project to improve my NodeJs and JavaScript skills.
This project basicly include 2 sections: books and authors.
You can add author or book. You need to select an author to add book.
An author dont have to have a book. But a book cannot exist without author.
