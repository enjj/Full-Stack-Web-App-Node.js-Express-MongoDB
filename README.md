# Full Stack Web App With Node.js-Express-MongoDB
### I made this project to improve my NodeJs and JavaScript skills.
This project basicly include 2 sections: books and authors.
You can add author or book. You need to select an author to add book.
An author doesn't have to have a book. But a book cannot exist without author.
